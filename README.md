# Coursera final project for SVN

This repository marks the first step in our micro-finance startup’s transition from Subversion (SVN) to Git for source control. As a company committed to empowering low-income individuals through accessible financial solutions, adopting modern version control practices will help us build more reliable, collaborative, and scalable software.

This repository includes:
	•	A sample script to calculate simple interest, serving as a foundational financial tool.
	•	Hosting the code on GitHub as a demonstration of our new workflow.
	•	A foundation for open-source collaboration, including:
	•	A clear and inclusive Code of Conduct
	•	Well-defined Contribution Guidelines
	•	An open and permissive Apache License 2.0
